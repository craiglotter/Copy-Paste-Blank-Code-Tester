Copy-Paste-Blank-Code-Tester
============================

Copy Paste Blank Code Tester is essentially a blank Visual Basic .NET (Studio 2003) project (Both Console and Windows Forms available) that allows for the quick and easy testing of code found on the Internet. It simply means that a new project doesn't have to be created for every little piece of code you want to see put into action.  Created by Craig Lotter, December 2005
